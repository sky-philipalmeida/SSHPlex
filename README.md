**Multiplex your SSH connections with style**

SSHplex is a Python-based SSH connection multiplexer that provides a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) for selecting and connecting to multiple hosts simultaneously using tmux. Built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, SSHplex integrates with NetBox as a Source of Truth and creates organized tmux sessions for efficient multi-host management.

## ⚠️ Development Status

```bash
pip install sshplex
```

This installs the `sshplex-cli` command for NetBox connectivity testing and configuration validation.

### From Source (Full TUI Application)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabrimjd/sshplex.git
cd sshplex
pip install -e .
```

This gives you access to the full TUI interface with tmux integration.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start SSHplex**: Run `python3 sshplex.py`
2. **Select Hosts**: Use the TUI to browse and select hosts from NetBox
3. **Configure Session**: Choose between panes or windows, enable/disable broadcasting
4. **Connect**: SSHplex creates a tmux session and establishes SSH connections
5. **Work**: Use tmux commands to navigate between hosts
6. **Detach/Reattach**: Use `Ctrl+b d` to detach, `tmux attach` to reattach

### tmux Commands (once attached)

```bash
# Navigation
Ctrl+b + Arrow Keys    # Switch between panes
Ctrl+b + n/p          # Next/Previous window
Ctrl+b + 0-9          # Switch to window by number

# Session management
Ctrl+b + d            # Detach from session
tmux list-sessions    # List all tmux sessions
tmux attach -t <name> # Attach to specific session

# Pane management
Ctrl+b + x            # Close current pane
Ctrl+b + z            # Zoom/unzoom current pane
```

### Host Search

Press `/` to open the search bar. Queries support full boolean logic across all visible columns (name, IP, cluster, tags, description, provider).

| Query | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `web` | Hosts with a field token matching "web" (e.g. matches `web-server-01`) |
| `web server` | Hosts matching both "web" AND "server" (space = AND) |
| `web OR db` | Hosts matching either "web" or "db" |
| `(galera AND plus) NOT arb` | Hosts matching galera+plus in any field, excluding those with "arb" |
| `web NOT test` | Hosts with "web" but not "test" |
| `NOT staging` | Exclude all hosts with "staging" in any field |
| `name:galera` | Match "galera" in the name column only |
| `aler*` | Prefix wildcard — matches `alertmanager`, `alerting`, etc. |
| `*ler*` | Infix wildcard — matches any token containing "ler" |

Boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` are case-sensitive. Bare terms match whole tokens; use `*term*` for substring matching. Press `Escape` to close the search bar.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

SSHplex now supports a flexible import-based configuration system that allows multiple named instances of any provider type:

```yaml
sot:
  providers: ["static", "netbox", "ansible"]  # Available provider types
  import:
    # Multiple static providers
    - name: "production-servers"
      type: static
      hosts:
        - name: "web-server-01"

  table_columns: ["name", "ip", "cluster", "tags", "description", "provider"]
```

### Legacy Configuration (Still Supported)

The original configuration format is still supported for backward compatibility:

#### NetBox Configuration

```yaml
sot:
  providers: ["netbox"]  # Use NetBox only

netbox:
  url: "https://netbox.example.com"
  token: "your-api-token"
  verify_ssl: true
  timeout: 30
  default_filters:
    status: "active"           # Only active hosts
    role: "virtual-machine"    # Only VMs
    platform: "linux"         # Only Linux hosts
#### Static Host Lists

```yaml
sot:
  providers: ["static"]  # Use static hosts only
  import:
    - name: "my-servers"
      type: static
      hosts:
        - name: "server-01"
          ip: "192.168.1.10"
          description: "Web server"
          tags: ["web", "production"]
        - name: "server-02"
          ip: "192.168.1.11"
          description: "Database server"
          tags: ["database", "production"]
```

  import:
    # Production static hosts
    - name: "prod-critical"
      type: static
      hosts:
        - name: "prod-lb-01"
          ip: "10.0.1.10"
          description: "Production Load Balancer"
          tags: ["production", "critical", "loadbalancer"]

    # Production NetBox
    - name: "prod-netbox"
      type: netbox

      token: "dev-token"
      default_filters:
        status: "active"
        cluster: "development"

ui:
  table_columns: ["name", "ip", "cluster", "tags", "provider"]  # Show provider source
```

### Ansible Inventory Format

SSHplex supports standard Ansible YAML inventory files:

```yaml
# Example inventory.yml
all:
  children:
    production:
      children:
        web_servers:
          hosts:
            web1:
              ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
              ansible_user: ubuntu
              ansible_port: 2222
              environment: prod
            web2:
              ansible_host: 192.168.1.11
              ansible_user: ubuntu
              environment: prod
        db_servers:
          hosts:
            db1:
              ansible_host: 192.168.2.10
              ansible_user: postgres
              environment: prod
    staging:
      hosts:
        staging-web:
          ansible_host: 192.168.100.10
          ansible_user: ubuntu
          environment: staging
```

### Group Filtering

Filter hosts by Ansible groups or parent groups:

```yaml
ansible_inventory:
  default_filters:
    groups: ["production"]        # All hosts in production group
    # groups: ["web_servers"]     # Only web servers
    # groups: ["db_servers"]      # Only database servers
```

### tmux Layouts

Choose how SSH connections are arranged:

- `tiled`: Automatic tiling layout (default)
- `even-horizontal`: Horizontal split
- `even-vertical`: Vertical split

### Logging Control

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: false  # Disable logging completely
  level: "ERROR"  # Only show errors
  file: "logs/sshplex.log"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NetBox Connection Failed**
   - Verify URL and API token
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure SSL settings match your NetBox instance

2. **Ansible Inventory Not Loading**
   - Verify inventory file paths exist and are readable
   - Check YAML syntax with `yamllint` or similar tool
   - Ensure inventory files follow Ansible format
   - Verify group names in filters match inventory structure

3. **No Hosts Found After Filtering**
   - Check that group filters match existing groups in inventory
   - Verify NetBox filters match available hosts
   - Try removing filters temporarily to see all available hosts
   - Check provider names in logs to ensure all providers are initializing

4. **Static Hosts Not Appearing**
   - Verify YAML syntax in configuration file
   - Check that host entries have required `name` and `ip` fields
   - Ensure static provider is listed in `sot.providers` array

5. **Multiple Provider Issues**
   - Check provider names are unique in `sot.import` list
   - Verify each provider type is listed in `sot.providers` array
   - Check logs to see which providers initialized successfully
   - Ensure at least one provider is properly configured

6. **Provider Column Not Showing**
   - Add `"provider"` to `ui.table_columns` in configuration
   - Clear cache and restart SSHplex to refresh UI

7. **SSH Key Authentication Failed**
   - Verify SSH key path in configuration
   - Ensure key has proper permissions (`chmod 600`)
   - Test manual SSH connection to target hosts

8. **tmux Session Not Created**
   - Ensure tmux is installed and in PATH
   - Check SSH connectivity to at least one host
   - Verify tmux is not already running a session with the same name

9. **Mixed Provider Issues**
   - SSHplex continues with available providers if one fails
   - Check logs to see which providers initialized successfully
   - Ensure at least one provider is properly configured

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
